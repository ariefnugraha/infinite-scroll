                Sarah watched the whirlpool mesmerized. She couldn't take her eyes off
                the water swirling around and around. She stuck in small twigs and
                leaves to watch the whirlpool catch them and then suck them down. It
                bothered her more than a little bit that this could also be used as a
                metaphor for her life.

                They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river
                was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to
                everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. So it
                was with great surprise that on this day the green river was a
                fluorescent pink.

                It was a rat's nest. Not a literal one, but that is what her hair
                seemed to resemble every morning when she got up. It was going to take
                at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of
                it. She peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. It
                wasn't. She opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers.

                He wondered if he should disclose the truth to his friends. It would
                be a risky move. Yes, the truth would make things a lot easier if they
                all stayed on the same page, but the truth might fracture the group
                leaving everything in even more of a mess than it was not telling the
                truth. It was time to decide which way to go.

                The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that
                they thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that
                even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. At
                that, they probably didn't have too much time after they detected us
                orbiting and intending to land. And if that were true, there could be
                only one place where their civilization was hidden.

                Puppies are soft, cute, funny, and make a big mess. Every month or two
                our family fosters 6-12 week old puppies for a puppy rescue nonprofit
                organization. We all enjoy cuddling their furry bodies after a clean
                bath. Fresh puppy smell is great. The puppies play with each other and
                our adult dog. They look so funny when they lay on top of each other
                and sleep. While puppies can be great fun, they also can make big
                messes. 4-6 puppies can make a lot of puppy pee and poop. It's a
                challenge to keep the puppies and the puppy pen clean.

                The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn't seem like an important
                choice when he was making it, but it was a choice nonetheless. Had he
                known the consequences at that time, he would likely have considered
                the choice a bit longer. In the end, he didn't and ended up choosing
                blue.

                The light was out on the front porch of the house. This was strange.
                Judy couldn't remember a time when she had ever seen it out. She
                hopped out of her car and walked to the door. It was slightly ajar and
                she knew this meant something terrible. She gently pushed the door
                open and hall her fears were realized. "Surprise! Happy Birthday!"
                everyone shouted.

                The bowl was filled with fruit. It seemed to be an overabundance of
                strawberries, but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes,
                and banana slices. This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start
                her day since she could remember. Why she decided to add chocolate as
                an option today was still a bit of a surprise, but she had been in the
                process of deciding she wanted to change her routine. This was a baby
                step to begin that start.

                It was cloudy outside but not really raining. There was a light
                sprinkle at most and there certainly wasn't a need for an umbrella.
                This hadn't stopped Sarah from pulling her umbrella out and opening
                it. It had nothing to do with the weather or the potential rain later
                that day. Sarah used the umbrella to hide.

                There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the
                ground, but Rachael could see movement. She squinted her eyes and
                peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly
                what she had spied. The more she peered, however, the more she thought
                it might be a figment of her imagination. Nothing seemed to move until
                the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree. Then in the corner
                of her eye, she would see the movement again and begin the process of
                staring again.

                The paper was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been
                writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. The fact that
                the writing wasn't there was frustrating. Actually, it was even more
                than frustrating. It was downright distressing.
